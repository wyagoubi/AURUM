# AURUM — Luxury Hotel Booking Platform

> *"Where Luxury Finds You"*

AURUM is a full-stack luxury hotel booking platform designed as a university software engineering project. It combines modern web technologies with relational database principles to deliver an end-to-end reservation system. The application supports guest reservations, hotel owner management tools, and AI-assisted customer interaction.

Its architecture consists of a client-side web interface, a RESTful application layer, and a PostgreSQL database structured through SQL schema definitions and automated initialization scripts (initDb.js), ensuring scalability, consistency, and deployment automation.

## 🔗 Live Demo

> The application is fully live. You can register as a guest or owner, search hotels, complete a booking, and chat with the AI concierge.

## ✨ Features

### 👤 Guest Features

- **Hotel Search** — Search by destination (city or country), number of rooms, number of children, and nightly budget. Results are fetched from the API and filtered client-side for instant response.

- 
- **Hotel Galleries** — Each hotel has a multi-tab photo gallery (Exterior, Lobby, Rooms, Amenities) using real Unsplash images. Room types also have individual photos.

- 
- **Booking Flow** — A full booking modal lets guests pick check-in/check-out dates, room type, and enter mock payment details with card number validation (Luhn algorithm).

- 
- **My Reservations** — A dedicated page lists all past and upcoming bookings with status badges (Upcoming / In Stay / Past / Cancelled), total cost, and reference number.
- **Countdown Badges** — Each reservation card shows how many days remain until check-in or check-out, updating in real time.

- 
- **1-Day Alerts** — A toast notification fires automatically when check-in or check-out is exactly one day away. Each alert fires only once per booking using `localStorage`.

- 
- **Cancel Reservation** — Guests can cancel upcoming bookings. The cancellation is sent to the API and the local cache is updated instantly — no page reload needed.

- 
- **AI Concierge** — A floating chatbot powered by the Claude/Groq API. The system prompt is built dynamically from live hotel data in the database. The concierge responds in the same language the user writes in and keeps answers to 2–3 sentences.

- 
- **Dark / Light Theme** — A theme toggle switches between a dark luxury palette and a light mode. The preference is saved in `localStorage` and applied on every page.

- 
- **Offline-First Cache** — After a successful API fetch, all bookings are saved to `localStorage`. If the user signs out or loses connectivity, their reservations remain visible from cache.

### 🏨 Owner Features

- **List Property** — A multi-step wizard guides hotel owners through adding a new property: hotel details → room types and prices → amenities → review and submit.

- 
- **Owner Dashboard** — An analytics page displays total revenue, total bookings, occupancy rate, and average nightly rate — all computed server-side from real booking data.

- 
- **Room Status Management** — A visual room grid lets owners mark individual rooms as Available, Occupied, or Under Maintenance.

### ⚙️ Technical Highlights

- **Dual-Mode Authentication** — Session cookies (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=none`, `Secure=true`) are used for browser clients. A signed HMAC Bearer token (stored in `localStorage`) is used as a fallback for cross-origin or expired-session scenarios. Both are verified by the same `getAuth()` middleware.

- 
- **Cross-Origin Setup** — The frontend (GitHub Pages) and backend (Render.com) are on different domains. CORS is configured to reflect the allowed origin with `credentials: true`. The session cookie is set with `SameSite=none; Secure` to work across domains.

- 
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Every protected route checks `req.auth.role`. Owner-only routes (`/owner/properties`, `/analytics/dashboard`) reject guest tokens with HTTP 403.

- 
- **Auto-Seeding Database** — On every deployment, `initDb.js` creates all tables if they don't exist and seeds 12 sample hotels with rooms, prices, and amenities — no manual SQL needed.

- **I used Node.js for backend logic, but the database is fully designed using SQL. I also provided separate SQL scripts (schema and seed) to comply with relational database requirements

SQL مستعمل لكن بطريقة مدمجة داخل backend + ملفات منفصلة
- 
- **Responsive Design** — Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile. Mobile navigation uses a slide-in menu. CSS custom properties (`--gold`, `--text`, `--bg`) power both dark and light themes from a single stylesheet.

- 
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — No frontend frameworks. All DOM manipulation, routing between pages, modal management, and API communication is written in plain JavaScript.

## 🚀 Setup & Deployment

### Frontend — GitHub Pages

1. Create a **public** repository on GitHub and upload all frontend files
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source: main branch / root**
3. Open every `.js` file and set the API base URL on the first line:

```js
const API_BASE = 'https://your-backend.onrender.com/api';
```

### Backend — Render.com

1. Push the backend folder to a **private** GitHub repository
2. On Render.com, create a new **Web Service** and connect the repo
3. Set **Build Command:** `npm install`
4. Set **Start Command:** `node src/initDb.js && node src/index.js`
5. Create a **PostgreSQL** database on Render — the `DATABASE_URL` is set automatically

### Environment Variables

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (auto-set by Render) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Long random string for signing session cookies |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API key for Groq or any OpenAI-compatible provider |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the AI provider (e.g. `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`) |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Model name (e.g. `llama-3.1-8b-instant`) |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Frontend origin for CORS (e.g. `https://wyagoubi.github.io`) |
